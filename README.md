# GitHub Version Control Assignment

This repository contains my first GitHub version control assignment.  
In this project, I practiced using Git and Git Bash to:
- Initialize a repository  
- Add and commit files  
- Push changes to GitHub  
- Create and manage a .gitignore file  

The files included are:
- assignment.txt → contains a short description of what I learned.
- .gitignore → excludes unnecessary system and environment files.
- README.md → explains the purpose of this repository.
